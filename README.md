# intro_to_airflow

Back in November 2019 I started learning Airflow as part of my Udacity Nanodegree for Data Engineering (which I did not complete due to limited time). This essentially (1) builds the table in Postgres that the data will be staged in and (2) pulls 7 days worth of data from one of NASA's APIs.

While I did not do any additional work to this code, I would have liked to split out the ETL script into smaller chunks to create more Airflow tasks.
